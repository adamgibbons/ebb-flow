# ebb-flow
Low and high tide predictions by zip code. Built with Node and React using Flux architecture.

##
Clone the app, change into its top-level directory, and install required node modules:
```
git@github.com:adamgibbons/ebb-flow.git

cd ebb-flow

npm install
```

Build the app with webpack (and watch for file changes):
```
npm run watch
```

If you're on Mac or Linux, run your build-in Python server and visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888):
```
npm run serve # for now, this just runs 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888'
```
